My very first review at ZDNET was of [Secretlab's Titan Evo 2022](https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26675287&tid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), a premium-built gaming chair that has since become a staple of my home office -- and virtually any major esports league that you can think of. 

It sits comfortably at the top of ZDNET's [best gaming chairs](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-chair/) list and continues to be my chair recommendation of choice should you want to alleviate any back pain, while feeling like a king. 

Still, chairs are meant to be sat on for years, and wear and tear is inevitable. The solution, according to Secretlab, has been in front of us the whole time: seat covers. You know, the ones that layer over car seats to cover up stains and damage, while bringing some much-needed flair to the standard polyester upholstery that you now regret opting for?

[Buy Secretlab Skins $169 at Secretlab](https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26675287&tid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

The company calls its new line of slim-fit covers Skins, aptly named for how seamlessly they wrap around the Titan Evo chairs. They're not cheap, ringing in [at $169](https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26675287&tid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), but are a fast and simple way to bring new life to your gaming chair.

For testing, Secretlab sent me a skin in a new Soda Purple color and the company's signature SoftWeave Plus fabric. I found it quick and easy to install.

June Wan/ZDNET

The installation process took about 5 minutes in total, with the two-piece layering latched on by a series of buckle belts and zippers. Skins come in small, regular, and XL sizes, and in 16 different designs -- 9 of which are specially-licensed with brands like "Game of Thrones", League of Legends, and DC Comics. 

As for the look and feel of it, the Soda Purple variant is a very subtle shade of purple -- pastel enough to not draw any attention -- and the best way I can describe the texture is cozy. Depending on how hard your gaming sessions go, the soft-touch fabric may or may not be ideal. But with the cooler temperatures where I live, I've found the warmer feel of the SoftWeave Plus material much more favorable than the PU leather that's now underneath.

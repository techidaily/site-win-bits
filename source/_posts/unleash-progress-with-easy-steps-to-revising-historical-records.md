## Action! 4.17.0 with OriSound function (record audio only from selected application) is now available!

**What's new in Action! 4.17.0?**

* NEW FEATURE: OriSound - long-awaited feature that allows to record audio exclusively from selected game or application!  
Don't waste money on additional PC or specialized headphones!  
Now you can select your favorite voice chat application (like Discord) and record it into separate audio track that will not be mixed with main audio track!  
Additionally the sound you record will never be modified by sound card post-processing - you always get the original volume, pitch and tone.  
It will also not get disturbed by random system "blips" comming from popup windows etc.  
    
HOW TO USE ORISOUND:  
    
1\. Use "Selected application" from audio device list (either primary, secondary or aux device).  
    
![](https://downloads.mirillis.com/files/audiograb_hint1.png)  
    
2\. A window will appear showing currently detected sound sources in the system (from system audio mixer)  
    
![](https://downloads.mirillis.com/files/audiograb_hint2.png)  
    
3\. If the application you want record sound from is not running or is not visible on the list you can use the '+' button to select its exe file (you need to manually find its location first)

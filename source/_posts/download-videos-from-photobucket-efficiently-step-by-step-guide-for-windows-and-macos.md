## Download Videos From Photobucket Efficiently: Step-by-Step Guide for Windows & macOS

### Overview

Photobucket is an image and video hosting and sharing website where people are free to upload their created video from a phone, camera, or computer. However, on Photobucket, downloading is not as that free as uploading. Even for registered members people are only allowed to download the video from public albums users upload, that is, the video people marked "public" not the ones marked "private". And what's worse is that all the Photobucket videos are in MP4 format, that is, you are only able to download Photobucket videos from public album as MP4 format.

Here come problems. What if users want to download all videos on Photobucket to their mobile devices or local computers not only form public album but also from private album?

### Brief Review of Wat.tv

Similar to YouTube and Dailymotion, Wat.tv, coming from France, is also a website for users to watch and share the videos as well as audios including music, TV series, sport news, funny recordings. Wat.tv is born in 2006 and attracts a large number of users. However, if you want to playback the videos from Wat.tv offline, it seems impossible. One reason is that Wat.tv does not provide downloading service, the other issue is the video links including HTTP and RTMP, are not easy to capture.

## Adding processes / applications to Action! exclude list

  
 Share this tutorial:

##  Introduction 

 If you do not want Action! to monitor selected applications or processes you can use Action! exlude list. In this tutorial you will learn how to create and manage exlude list. 

 Please remember that when selected application or process is added to exclude list it is not possible to record it with "Games and applications" mode and the HUD is not displayed for excluded applications.

##  Open Action! installation folder 

 Open Mirillis Action! installation folder. Default installation folder is:

* **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mirillis\\Action!** \- for 64bit Windows version
* **C:\\Program Files\\Mirillis\\Action!** \- for 32bit Windows version

##  Create Mirillis Action! exclude list file 

 Create a new txt file and rename it to **"exclude"**. You can create txt file in example on your desktop, use right mouse button on your desktop and select **New -> Text Document**.

![Mirillis Action! - exclude file](https://mirillis.com/res/old/gfx/tutorials/hardware_settings/mirillis_action_exclude_file.jpg "Action! exclude file") 

 Move **exclude.txt** file to Action! installation folder.

##  Check process / application name 

 Now check the name of the process or application you want to add to exclude list. Make sure that application you want to exclude is running and open Task Manager. Localize your selected process one the list. In our example it will be **test.exe** 

![Mirillis Action! - Activate tab](https://mirillis.com/res/old/gfx/tutorials/hardware_settings/mirillis_action_exclude_task_manager.jpg "Select activate tab") 

## Add process to exclude list 

 Close Action!, edit **exclude.txt**, type in selected process name and save file. Run Action!. Action! will not monitor and will not display HUD for processes listed in exclude.txt. 

![Mirillis Action! - Activation window](https://mirillis.com/res/old/gfx/tutorials/hardware_settings/mirillis_action_edit_exclude_list.jpg "Activation window with all fields filled in") 

 To exclude more processes enter every process name in a new line.
